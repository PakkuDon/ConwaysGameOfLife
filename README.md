# Conway's Game of Life

[Demo.](https://github.com/PakkuDon/ConwaysGameOfLife)

[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) written in JavaScript. Was originally started as practice for the 2015 Global Day of Coderetreat.

Features use of HTML5 Canvas, TDD using [Jasmine 2.3](http://jasmine.github.io/) and some [CSS-related shenanigans](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes#Browser_compatibility) that probably won't work in IE 11 and below.
